----------Margin & Padding------------
Margin have a strange behaviour where they merge together which can cause 
confusion and problems

The spacing between headings, paragraphs are controlled by margin-top, margin-bottom
By default, the margin-top and margin-bottom fot headings/paragraphs = their font-size

Turn off margin-top on typography on elements so can have little things to maintain and keep track off
but still maintain a consistent layout 

Block level elements by default occupy the entire width of their parent element, so we can say they
create a "block". Hence, they create a new line of content and stack on top of each other by default. 

An inline element on the other hand by default doesn't occupy the entire width of the parent it
only takes as much width as necessary for the content 
--------Rules of Inline--------
You can only nest other inline elements in them
They only respect left/right margin and padding
